f = [-1 ];

A =  [-1 -2 1 -1;
      4 3 4 -2;];
b=[0; 3];

Aeq=[-1 -1 2 1;];
beq=[1];

lb = [-999999999 0 0 0];

[x,fval,exitflag,output,lambda] = linprog(f,A,b,Aeq,beq,lb);

%{
starts with output stuff
x is a vector of the variables
fval is the optimal value for the objective function
exit flag is a number that tells you the reason for the termination 
    of the algorithm
output is a structure that tells you certian other things such as the
    number of iterations
lambda is the values of the lagrange multipliers (AKA dual variables)

for the inputs we of course need to pass it f,a,&b
the next two spots are for equality constraints
first the A matrix associated with the equalities
then the b vector that goes with the equalities
next we need to pass the lower bound for x 
and after that we can pass it the upper bound for x
